## 📝 Program Description

ExacWeather application prompts the user to enter a city name in order to display its forecast. Once a valid city name is entered, the application directs them to the forecast page that displays the current temperature, weather description and the sunrise/sunset times (sources directly from an integreated microservice written by collaborator Nico Davis). Additionally, the application presents the user with the 5-day forecast with the high and low temperatures for the upcoming days. Users can effortlessly toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit as per their preference. If the user would like to view another city's forecast they can input a new search at the top of the page. In instances of invalid city inputs, the forecast page informs the user and defaults to Los Angeles, ensuring a consistent user experience.
